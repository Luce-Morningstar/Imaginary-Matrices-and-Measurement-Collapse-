## Abstract

We propose a novel framework where imaginary matrices are treated as physically meaningful constructs governing the collapse of quantum potential into classical reality. By extending Euler's identity into a collapse operator, defining collapse field dynamics via gradient flows and Laplacian curvature, and introducing a Collapse Ricci Tensor, we outline a coherent bridge between quantum indeterminacy and deterministic classical behavior.
